# What is this?

This Salesforce application is just a simple proof of concept application that will allow SF licenses and users to be allocated to 'pools' - useful for large implementations where projects/budgets but licenses for groups of users and that allocation needs to be tracked and reported. E.g "Finance have 20 new starters next month, we've purchased 20 new licenses".
